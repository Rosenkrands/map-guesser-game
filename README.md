# 🇩🇰 Danish City Map Guesser

A minimalist city guessing game built with **Angular** and **MapLibre
GL**.

Identify Danish cities using an abstract, label-free map showing only
roads and water. Adjust the population threshold to control difficulty
and aim for the longest streak.

---

## 🎯 Gameplay

1.  Set a **minimum population** using the slider
2.  A random Danish city above the threshold is selected
3.  A **highly minimal vector map** is shown (no labels, no landmarks)
4.  Type the city name and submit your guess
5.  Correct guess → streak increases\
    Wrong guess → streak resets and the correct answer is revealed

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Vector tiles only (no raster maps)
- Roads & water as the sole visual clues
- Strong contrast (black on white)
- Fixed zoom and locked interactions for fairness
- No backend required

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Angular
- MapLibre GL JS
- OpenMapTiles vector data
- TypeScript
- Static JSON city dataset

## 🗺 Map Rendering

- Vector tiles via MapLibre GL
- Custom style files control difficulty
- No labels, POIs, buildings, or landuse
- Locked interaction (no pan, zoom, rotate)
